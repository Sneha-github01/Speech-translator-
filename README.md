This Python project is a simple voice translator that uses speech recognition and the Google Translate API to convert spoken English into spoken French. It begins by importing necessary libraries such as os, speech_recognition, google_translator, gtts, and playsound. The program initializes a recognizer to process audio input and sets up a translator object for language conversion. It continuously listens to the user's speech through the microphone, converts the spoken words into English text using Google's speech recognition engine, and then translates that text into French. Once translated, it uses the gTTS library to convert the French text into speech and saves it as an MP3 file. The program then plays the audio using the playsound library and removes the temporary file afterward. The loop continues to run until the user says exit, which ends the program. It also includes error handling to manage cases when the speech isnâ€™t understood or when there's a problem with the translation service. This project serves as a basic prototype, ideal for learning how different voice and language processing libraries can be integrated, but it can be extended further for better performance, multilingual support, and an improved user experience.
